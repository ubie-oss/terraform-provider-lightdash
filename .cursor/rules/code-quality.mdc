# Code Quality Enforcement Rule

To ensure high code quality and maintainability, the Cursor Agent must proactively check the following before and after making any code changes:

- **Linting:** Run `make lint` to check for linter errors and warnings.
- **Formatting:** Run `make format` to automatically format the codebase according to project standards.
- **Build:** Run `make build` to verify that the codebase builds successfully after changes.

## Instructions for Cursor Agent
- Always run `make lint`, `make format`, and `make build` after making code changes, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- If any of these checks fail, report the errors and do not consider the change complete until all checks pass.
- Reference this rule as needed to justify code quality checks in your workflow.
