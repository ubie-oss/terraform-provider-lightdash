Rule Name: examples
Description:
- The `examples` directory contains runnable and documentation examples for the Lightdash Terraform provider.
- Only `provider/provider.tf`, `data-sources/<data_source_name>/data-source.tf`, and `resources/<resource_name>/resource.tf` are used for documentation generation.
- Other files (e.g., `import.sh`) are for manual testing and user reference.
- Example files are organized by resource or data source name in their respective subdirectories.
