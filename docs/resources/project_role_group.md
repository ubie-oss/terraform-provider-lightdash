# lightdash_project_role_group (Resource)

Manages the assignment of a Lightdash group to a specific role within a project. This resource allows you to control the permissions granted to an entire group for a given project. You need to specify the project UUID, the group UUID, and the desired role (e.g., `viewer`, `editor`, `developer`). Using this resource ensures that group access is managed declaratively.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "lightdash_project_role_group" "test" {
  project_uuid = "xxx-xxx-xxxx"
  group_uuid   = "xxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxx"
  role         = "editor"
}
```
