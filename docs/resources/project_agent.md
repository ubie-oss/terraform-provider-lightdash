# lightdash_project_agent (Resource)

Manages a Lightdash project agent. This resource represents an AI agent configured within a Lightdash project. Currently, this resource only supports reading existing agents and does not support creating, updating, or deleting agents.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "lightdash_project_agent" "test" {
  organization_uuid = "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
  project_uuid      = "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
  name              = "Test Agent"
  instruction       = "You are a helpful AI assistant for data analysis."

  tags = ["test", "terraform"]

  enable_data_access      = true
  enable_self_improvement = true

  group_access = ["xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"]
  user_access  = ["xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"]

  deletion_protection = true

  # If you want to manually change the instruction on the web UI of LIghtdash,
  # you can ignore the changes to the instruction.
  # lifecycle {
  #   ignore_changes = [
  #     instruction
  #   ]
  # }
}
```
