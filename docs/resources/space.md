  Lightdash space is a powerful feature of the Lightdash platform that allows you to create and manage spaces for your analytics projects. With Lightdash space, you can organize your data, dashboards, and reports into separate spaces, providing a logical separation and access control for different teams or projects. Each space has a unique identifier (UUID) and can be associated with a project. You can specify whether a space is private or not, allowing you to control who can access the space. Additionally, you can enable deletion protection for a space, preventing accidental deletion during Terraform operations. The created_at and last_updated attributes provide timestamps for the creation and last update of the space, respectively. The access block allows you to define the users who have access to the space by specifying their user UUIDs. Each access block should contain a single attribute 'user_uuid' which is a required string attribute representing the user UUID. Lightdash space is a flexible and scalable solution for managing your analytics projects and ensuring data security and access control.

## Example Usage

```terraform
##########################################################################
# Public and private spaces
##########################################################################
resource "lightdash_space" "test_public" {
  project_uuid = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
  name         = "zzz_test_private_space"
  // The visibility is private by default.
  is_private = true

  deletion_protection = false
}


resource "lightdash_space" "test_privacte" {
  project_uuid = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
  name         = "zzz_test_private_space"
  // The visibility is private by default.
  is_private = true

  deletion_protection = false

  access {
    user_uuid = "xxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx"
  }

  access {
    user_uuid = "xxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx"
  }
}

##########################################################################
# Nested spaces
##########################################################################
resource "lightdash_space" "test_parent_space" {
  project_uuid        = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
  name                = "zzz_test_parent_space"
  is_private          = true
  deletion_protection = false
}

resource "lightdash_space" "test_child_space" {
  project_uuid        = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
  parent_space_uuid   = lightdash_space.test_parent_space.space_uuid
  name                = "zzz_test_child_space"
  is_private          = true
  deletion_protection = false
}

resource "lightdash_space" "test_grandchild_space" {
  project_uuid        = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
  parent_space_uuid   = lightdash_space.test_child_space.space_uuid
  name                = "zzz_test_grandchild_space"
  is_private          = true
  deletion_protection = false
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `deletion_protection` (Boolean) Whether or not to allow Terraform to destroy the instance. Unless this field is set to false in Terraform state, a terraform destroy or terraform apply that would delete the instance will fail.
- `name` (String) Lightdash project name
- `project_uuid` (String) Lightdash project UUID

### Optional

- `access` (Block Set) This block represents the access settings for the Lightdash space. It allows you to define the users who have access to the space by specifying their user UUIDs. Each access block should contain a single attribute 'user_uuid' which is a required string attribute representing the user UUID. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--access))
- `group_access` (Block Set) This block represents the access settings for the Lightdash space. It allows you to define the groups who have access to the space by specifying their group UUIDs. Each group access block should contain a single attribute 'group_uuid' which is a required string attribute representing the group UUID. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--group_access))
- `is_private` (Boolean) Lightdash project is private or not
- `parent_space_uuid` (String) Lightdash parent space UUID

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Timestamp of the creation of the space
- `id` (String) Resource identifier
- `last_updated` (String) Timestamp of the last Terraform update of the space.
- `space_uuid` (String) Lightdash space UUID

<a id="nestedblock--access"></a>
### Nested Schema for `access`

Required:

- `space_role` (String) Lightdash space role
- `user_uuid` (String) User UUID

Read-Only:

- `is_organization_admin` (Boolean) Indicates if the user's access is managed by Terraform.Note: It is not possible to manage space access for organization admins through Terraform because they inherently have access to all spaces within the organization by default.


<a id="nestedblock--group_access"></a>
### Nested Schema for `group_access`

Required:

- `group_uuid` (String) Group UUID
- `space_role` (String) Lightdash space role

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Spaces can be imported by specifying the resource identifier.
terraform import lightdash_space.example "projects/${project-uuid}/spaces/${space_uuid}"
```
