  Lightash space is a powerful feature of the Lightdash platform that allows you to create and manage spaces for your analytics projects. With Lightash space, you can organize your data, dashboards, and reports into separate spaces, providing a logical separation and access control for different teams or projects. Each space has a unique identifier (UUID) and can be associated with a project. You can specify whether a space is private or not, allowing you to control who can access the space. Additionally, you can enable deletion protection for a space, preventing accidental deletion during Terraform operations. The createdat and lastupdated attributes provide timestamps for the creation and last update of the space, respectively. The access block allows you to define the users who have access to the space by specifying their user UUIDs. Each access block should contain a single attribute 'user_uuid' which is a required string attribute representing the user UUID. Lightash space is a flexible and scalable solution for managing your analytics projects and ensuring data security and access control.

# lightdash_space (Resource)

Lightash space is a powerful feature of the Lightdash platform that allows you to create and manage spaces for your analytics projects. With Lightash space, you can organize your data, dashboards, and reports into separate spaces, providing a logical separation and access control for different teams or projects. Each space has a unique identifier (UUID) and can be associated with a project. You can specify whether a space is private or not, allowing you to control who can access the space. Additionally, you can enable deletion protection for a space, preventing accidental deletion during Terraform operations. The created_at and last_updated attributes provide timestamps for the creation and last update of the space, respectively. The access block allows you to define the users who have access to the space by specifying their user UUIDs. Each access block should contain a single attribute 'user_uuid' which is a required string attribute representing the user UUID. Lightash space is a flexible and scalable solution for managing your analytics projects and ensuring data security and access control.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "lightdash_space" "test_public" {
  project_uuid = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
  name         = "zzz_test_private_space"
  // The visibility is private by default.
  is_private = true

  deletion_protection = false
}


resource "lightdash_space" "test_privacte" {
  project_uuid = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
  name         = "zzz_test_private_space"
  // The visibility is private by default.
  is_private = true

  deletion_protection = false

  access {
    user_uuid = "xxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx"
  }

  access {
    user_uuid = "xxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `deletion_protection` (Boolean) Whether or not to allow Terraform to destroy the instance. Unless this field is set to false in Terraform state, a terraform destroy or terraform apply that would delete the instance will fail.
- `name` (String) Lightdash project name
- `project_uuid` (String) Lightdash project UUID

### Optional

- `access` (Block Set) This block represents the access settings for the Lightdash space. It allows you to define the users who have access to the space by specifying their user UUIDs. Each access block should contain a single attribute 'user_uuid' which is a required string attribute representing the user UUID. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--access))
- `is_private` (Boolean) Lightdash project is private or not

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Timestamp of the creation of the space
- `id` (String) Resource identifier
- `last_updated` (String) Timestamp of the last Terraform update of the space.
- `space_uuid` (String) Lightdash space UUID

<a id="nestedblock--access"></a>
### Nested Schema for `access`

Required:

- `user_uuid` (String) User UUID

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Spaces can be imported by specifying the resource identifier.
terraform import lightdash_space.example "projects/${project-uuid}/spaces/${space_uuid}"
```
