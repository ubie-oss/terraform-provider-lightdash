# lightdash_space (Resource)

A Lightdash space resource manages spaces within a Lightdash project. This resource allows for the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of spaces, including setting their name, visibility (private/public), and managing deletion protection. It also supports configuring access for individual members and groups within the space.

## Example Usage

```terraform
##########################################################################
# Public and private spaces
##########################################################################
resource "lightdash_space" "test_public" {
  project_uuid = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
  name         = "zzz_test_private_space"
  // The visibility is private by default.
  is_private = true

  deletion_protection = false
}


resource "lightdash_space" "test_privacte" {
  project_uuid = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
  name         = "zzz_test_private_space"
  // The visibility is private by default.
  is_private = true

  deletion_protection = false

  access {
    user_uuid  = "xxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx"
    space_role = "editor"
  }

  access {
    user_uuid  = "xxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx"
    space_role = "viewer"
  }
}

##########################################################################
# Nested spaces
##########################################################################
resource "lightdash_space" "test_parent_space" {
  project_uuid        = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
  name                = "zzz_test_parent_space"
  is_private          = true
  deletion_protection = false
}

// Nested spaces inherit visibility and access from the root space.
resource "lightdash_space" "test_child_space" {
  project_uuid        = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
  parent_space_uuid   = lightdash_space.test_parent_space.space_uuid
  name                = "zzz_test_child_space"
  deletion_protection = false
}

// Nested spaces inherit visibility and access from the root space.
resource "lightdash_space" "test_grandchild_space" {
  project_uuid        = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
  parent_space_uuid   = lightdash_space.test_child_space.space_uuid
  name                = "zzz_test_grandchild_space"
  deletion_protection = false
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `deletion_protection` (Boolean) When set to `true`, prevents the destruction of the space resource by Terraform. Defaults to `false`.
- `name` (String) The human-readable name of the space.
- `project_uuid` (String) The UUID of the Lightdash project this space belongs to.

### Optional

- `access` (Block Set) Manages direct user access to the space. Specify user UUIDs and their assigned roles. Note: Organization administrators have implicit access. This block is ignored for nested spaces. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--access))
- `group_access` (Block Set) Manages access to the space for groups. Specify group UUIDs and their assigned roles within the space. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--group_access))
- `is_private` (Boolean) Whether the space is private (`true`) or public (`false`). Note: This setting is ignored for nested spaces which inherit visibility.
- `parent_space_uuid` (String) The UUID of the parent space. Setting this creates a nested space that inherits access controls and visibility from its parent. Leave empty for a root space.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The timestamp when the space was created.
- `id` (String) The Terraform resource identifier. It is computed as `projects/<project_uuid>/spaces/<space_uuid>`.
- `last_updated` (String) The timestamp of the last Terraform update applied to the space.
- `space_uuid` (String) The UUID of the space assigned by Lightdash.

<a id="nestedblock--access"></a>
### Nested Schema for `access`

Required:

- `space_role` (String) The role assigned to the user within the space. Valid roles are `admin` (Full Access), `editor` (Can Edit), or `viewer` (Can View).
- `user_uuid` (String) The UUID of the Lightdash user.


<a id="nestedblock--group_access"></a>
### Nested Schema for `group_access`

Required:

- `group_uuid` (String) The UUID of the Lightdash group.
- `space_role` (String) The role assigned to the group within the space. Valid roles are `admin` (Full Access), `editor` (Can Edit), or `viewer` (Can View).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Spaces can be imported by specifying the resource identifier.
terraform import lightdash_space.example "projects/${project-uuid}/spaces/${space_uuid}"


terraform import \
  --var-file=testing.tfvars \
  lightdash_space.test_grandchild_space \
  "projects/9cc0bae8-f552-4ac0-bdcc-44933d7031ae/spaces/0ca1503b-e5c9-4698-b3db-bd7998974555"
```
