You can then use this group in other resources like `lightdash_project_role_group` to assign project-level roles.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "lightdash_group" "test_group1" {
  organization_uuid = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
  name              = "test_group1"
}


resource "lightdash_group" "test_group2" {
  organization_uuid = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
  name              = "test_group2"

  member {
    user_uuid = "xxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx"
  }

  member {
    user_uuid = "xxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx"
  }
