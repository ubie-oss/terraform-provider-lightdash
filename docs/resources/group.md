# lightdash_group (Resource)

A Lightdash group represents a set of users within an organization, providing a mechanism to manage permissions for projects and resources. Each group is uniquely identified by a UUID and is associated with a specific organization. Group membership is defined by the user UUIDs of the members.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "lightdash_group" "test_group1" {
  organization_uuid = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
  name              = "test_group1"
}


resource "lightdash_group" "test_group2" {
  organization_uuid = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxx"
  name              = "test_group2"

  member {
    user_uuid = "xxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx"
  }

  member {
    user_uuid = "xxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx"
  }
}
```
