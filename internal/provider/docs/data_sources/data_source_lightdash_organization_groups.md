Retrieves a list of all groups within a Lightdash organization. This data source provides details for each group, including its UUID, name, and creation timestamp. It requires the organization UUID as input and returns a list of groups sorted by their UUID. This is useful for discovering existing groups to use in other resources like `lightdash_project_role_group`.
