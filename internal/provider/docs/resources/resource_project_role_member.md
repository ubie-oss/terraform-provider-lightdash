Manages the assignment of a Lightdash member to a specific role within a project. This resource allows you to control the permissions granted to an individual user for a given project. You need to specify the project UUID, the user UUID, and the desired role (e.g., `viewer`, `editor`, `developer`, `admin`). Using this resource ensures that individual user access is managed declaratively at the project level.
