Manages a Lightdash space within a project. Spaces are used to organize charts and dashboards. This resource allows you to create, update, and delete spaces, and manage their visibility (public or private). You must specify the project UUID where the space will reside and a name for the space. Nested spaces are supported by specifying a parent space UUID. Both root and nested spaces can have their own access control settings (Restricted Access).
