Manages a Lightdash space within a project. Spaces are used to organize charts and dashboards. This resource allows you to create, update, and delete spaces, and manage their visibility (public or private). You must specify the project UUID where the space will reside and a name for the space. Optionally, you can specify a parent space UUID to create nested spaces.
